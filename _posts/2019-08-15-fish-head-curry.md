Fish head curry is immensely popular in Malaysia and Singapore. With South Indian origins, it uses a combination of various spices and ingredients to create its well accepted delectable taste.

#### <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Background
One of the most sought after curry in both Malaysian and Singapore is the fish head curry. Just like some dishes found in Malaysia and Singapore, this recipe has been adapted to the taste of the locals ever since it was introduced by the Indian migrants when they moved to the region. Thus, it is no surprise that fish head curry is not known in India.

It may be disturbing to know but the meat located at the jaws of red sea bream, below the gills and the back of the neck is sweet and delicate. It is where the layers of fine meat structure absorb the flavours of the curry or sauce that it is cooked in, hence making fish head much sought after when cooking curry.

As mentioned, red sea bream is typically used in fish head curry. Other white fleshed fishes such as sea bass, gilt-head bream or talapia are also suitable for making this flavourful curry.

#### <i class="far fa-thumbs-up"></i> Our Secret
Fish head curry must be thick in consistency. There is no two ways about it. There are two main steps which needs to be followed in order to obtain it. The first is to use rice. Having rice as an ingredient in curry may seemed unusual but the starch from the rice acts as a thickening agent. Secondly, the curry needs to be simmered until it reaches the desired thickness. Vegetables such as okras and aubergines are perfect for curries as they readily soak up the gravy.

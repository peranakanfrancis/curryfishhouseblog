Traditionally a Minangkabau (Indonesia) dish, variations of rendang are now found throughout Indonesia and Malaysia. This rich and flavourful chicken rendang is simple yet delicious.

#### <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Background
'Rendang' is a traditional Minangkabau dish. Over the centuries, this dish has been adapted to local cooking cultures and is now no longer only found in Indonesia but also available in neighbouring countries like Malaysia and Singapore.

The time taken to cook rendang is much longer than cooking curries as it thrives when cooked slowly. This rendang recipe has been shared by a Malay neighbour of mine using very simple ingredients which are easily found.

Rendang paste consists of chillies, galangal, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, shallots, kerisik and sometimes other spices as well.

A classic Chinese vegetable dish of stir-fried bean sprouts with salted fish, coloured capsicums (bell peppers), chillies, spring onions, and subtly flavoured with a dash of Chinese wine, chicken seasoning, salt and pepper.

#### <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Background
Bean sprouts are usually used as an accompanying ingredient in many Asian dishes especially noodles. Vietnamese cuisine uses bean sprouts generously in their dishes like Pho, for example. However, they are usually served raw. However, in Malaysia, bean sprouts are normally served lightly cooked.

This Chinese bean sprouts recipe is a favourite healthy option which is often paired with just plain rice. Drizzle blanched bean sprouts with some soy sauce mixture, fried salted fish and fried garlic for a simple meal.

#### <i class="far fa-thumbs-up"></i> Our Secret
You can enjoy this with bean sprouts, salted fish, coloured capsicums (bell peppers), chillies, and spring onions, thrown into the mix. It makes for a healthier dish, with the sweet-tasting capsicums adding a nice crunch, and enhancing the overall flavour of the dish. Furthermore, we use Chinese stir-fries that make it healthy, nutrient-rich dietary options for your family.

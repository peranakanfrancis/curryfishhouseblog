    "body": "We are proud to be Malaysian, and proud to offer the original Malaysia's flavour!: To show that we care about what we do, we provide only the best local fare to our customers.  NO ARTIFICIAL INGREDIENTS. NO PRESERVATIVES: We use 100% natural and fresh ingredients to make our otah and other food, and only prepare our dishes after you order. Because we believe in providing you the best, each of our food items comes with several options and combinations, so that you can choose what matches your own taste, occasion and lifestyle. WE USE HOME-MADE RECIPES: All our recipes come from the Family’s rich heritage, and our family’s own unique flavour. Even our ingredients, like our Curry sauce, are made from scratch. Most importantly, we keep it at affordable prices, so that you can enjoy authentic local food without burning a hole in your wallet.  We are committed to delivering only the freshest food to our customers. And for that, supermarkets won’t do. Neither will pre-packed, preserved food. We need to get the ingredients ourselves, fresh from the market, to be guaranteed of the best. The kitchen is the most important part of our business; it is where the food is produced. It must be working efficiently, because we promise to produce our food after you order. Efficiency is not the only important thing; so is hygiene and safety. All our staff are required to wear masks and gloves while working. Time has been allotted for them to be trained in proper methods of hygiene. This way, our customers will stay healthy and happy when eating our food. SPREADING OUR SECRET RECIPES TO EVERYONE: Like our kitchens, store staff are inspected for their quality as well. We train our staff to be friendly and lend a listening ear to customers’ needs. Because without you, the customer, where would we be tomorrow? We identify the profile of the people visiting our shops, and brainstorms new food items that will tickle your taste buds. We bear in mind our mission of spreading our unique authentic local curry flavour islandwide. ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE: With all this, you can be certain that at any of our stores, you will get only the best in terms of service and food quality. Bon Appetit!  "
